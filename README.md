# 📊 Product Profitability Analysis (SQL)

This project uses SQL to analyze and categorize product profitability within the AdventureWorks database. The goal is to uncover insights that can support data-driven business decisions such as identifying underperforming product categories.

- Product profitability analysis using `CASE` statements

- String and date manipulation using built-in SQL functions like `LEN()`, `LEFT()`, `DATENAME()`
- Aggregation with `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`
- Table joins between `Product`, `ProductCategory`, `ProductModel`, and `SalesOrderDetail`
